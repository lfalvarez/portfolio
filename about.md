Hello there! My name is Felipe Álvarez (my full name starts with Luis but I prefer Felipe for short), I am a civic-tech activist, I work at the chilean NGO [Fundación Ciudadano Inteligente](http://ciudadanointeligente.org/) as a Software Developer, but I do quite a few things, so my duties range from coding, to cleaning, to networking, to strategic planning and I also do a bit (very little) of design. I'm also a aerial silks performer and street performances organizer. I'm based in Santiago, Chile.

I'm very passionate about writing code (and automated tests), I also love reading code so I try to write my own as clear as possible. My prefered languages range from Javascript and NodeJs, to Python, Ruby and any dynamic languages.

And when it comes to aerial acrobatics my two favorite disciplines are [silks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_silk) and [corde lisse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corde_lisse).

I also love cycling around the city, for that I have two bikes, both of assembled by myself.

This portfolio is in support of my application to the Media Arts and Sciences (MAS) program at the [MediaLab](http://www.media.mit.edu/).

For creating this portfolio, I used a jekyll theme called Webjeda-cards you can read more at [Webjeda Blog](http://blog.webjeda.com). And you can find the code for this portfolio at [my github](https://github.com/lfalvarez/portfolio).
