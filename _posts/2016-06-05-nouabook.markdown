Faceebook is one of the most popular sites among moroccans, and also is inspiration for [SimSim-Participation Citoyenne](http://simsim.ma/) to create a site that allows  citizens to communicate with MPs. 

And as part of a [Poplus](/poplus/) community, they created [Nouabook.ma](http://nouabook.ma), which is built on top of [Write-It](/write-in-public/) and allows to send messages to MPs and receive public answers, much in the way you would do if you wanted to reach someone on Facebook.

Since its launch in 2014, it has had over 3,000 messages from citizens.

My role in Nouabook was in the first place to integrate it with [Write-It](/write-in-public/) and a technical consultant.
