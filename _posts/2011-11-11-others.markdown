This is a set of old project as well as funny ones.

Candideit.org (2012)
--------------------
[Candideit.org](http://candideit.org) is a platform that allows users to create their own questionary for choosing who is the closest candidate to their positions. I was developer and together with [Catalina](http://github.com/camargozzini) got the site running.

Users could create any set of questions and a small quiz that could be shared with your friends.


Ley del Lobby
-------------
As part of as a campaign for advocating for a Lobby Law in Chile, I acted in a spot.

I love riding my bike and I love to think when I'm riding, therefore I write stories (in Spanish) about it.
