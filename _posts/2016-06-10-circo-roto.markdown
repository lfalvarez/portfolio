During November of the year 2015, with a group of friends formed a collective around street art and circus, our main porpuse is to promote street performances as a form of art and open new spaces for upcoming artists.

We have been able to replicate this event with minor differences in several occasions.

Some of the things that I learned in this street performances are that people in the street art world do whatever it is in their hands to get people started and improving. That is something I have partly brought to my other civic-tech projects.
