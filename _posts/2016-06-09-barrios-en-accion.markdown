Context
----
BarriosEnAcción (NeighborhoodsInAction) is a reimplementation of the MySociety platform [FixMyStreet](http://fixmystreet.org/). It was a cooperation between [Fundación Ciudadano Inteligente](http://ciudadanointeligente.org) and [CiudadViva](http://ciudadviva.cl) a local NGO related to urban issues.

It coordinated the issues raised by the citizens of the communes of Providencia and Santiago in Chile.
For that, we extended parts of the original platform to integrate with the systems from the administration of the two municipalities.


It also features an Android app as well as an iPhone app, both of them were a fork of the original FixMyStreet platform that was originally developed by MySociety.

My role
-------
For this project, I adapted [FixMyStreet](http://fixmystreet.org/) with a different look. Also extended it to create adaptors for the platform of the Chilean Municipal citizen’s reports management systems.

Generated partnerships with two Chilean Municipalities, specifically with their
Departments of Computing, on behalf of Ciudad Viva, the lead organization
behind BarriosenAccion.
