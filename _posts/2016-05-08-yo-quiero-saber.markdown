During the argentinian elections presidential elections of 2015, a group formed by several activists using [VotaInteligente](/votainteligente/) created [YoQuieroSaber](http://www.yoquierosaber.org/). It was a heavily community driven effort to gather as much information about the candidates and their opinions to inform the citizens of Argentina. They formed a series of alliances with local media.

I played the role of backend developer and system administrator, I also helped the YQS team integrate their data into the existing platform.
