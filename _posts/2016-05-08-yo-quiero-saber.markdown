Context
-------
During the [argentinian presidential elections of 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_general_election,_2015), a network of organizations around better informing and educating voters. For that, and based on [VotaInteligente](/votainteligente/) they created [YoQuieroSaber](http://www.yoquierosaber.org/). It was a heavily community driven effort to gather as much information about the candidates and their opinions to inform the citizens of Argentina.

My role
-------
The YQS team decided that they wanted to have several changes to VotaInteligente, some of them were very related to they way the 'Political Soulmate' was calculated. I developed the necessary created an extensions system to which the YQS team could hook changes.

I played the role of backend developer and system administrator, I also helped the YQS team integrate their data into the existing platform.
