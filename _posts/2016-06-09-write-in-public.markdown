WriteIt is one of the components of [Poplus.org](http://poplus.org) and was originally conceived as Website that allows anyone to create their own site to send public messages to their politicians.

It has mainly been developed by Fundaci√≥n Ciudadano Inteligente and MySociety.

Has been used in several occassions by different grassroots organizations in different contexts, some of them are:

* [Nouabook](http://nouabook.ma/fr/) a moroccan site that aims to help moroccan citizens to comunicate with their de MPs.
* [Planning Alerts](https://www.planningalerts.org.au/) an Australian site that alerts citizens whenever there is a new plannig application. The particular role that WriteInPublic plays in the platform is that it allows citizens to speak publicly to the authority of the application.

It has also been used by other platforms from Ciudadano Inligente such as [CongresoAbierto.cl](http://congresoabierto.cl/).
