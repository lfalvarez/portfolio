Poplus is an open federation of civic tech activists and organizations that share experiences and code to make their work more impactful.

Its premise was that, over the world many organizations are building tools to help citizens help themselves to create a better communities, but in the process we all tend to create tools, that have in a way been deployed in a different contexts. So the first compeling idea was that we need to stop rebuilding the wheel and rather focus on reusing tools that have already been created by others. 

From poplus I started working on tools such as [WriteInPublic](/write-in-public/) and [Nouabook.ma](/nouabook/). It also gave me a wider vision on how our projects could use some previously created tools such as [BarriosEnAcción](/barrios-en-accion/). And how could our projects be used by others like [YoQuieroSaber](/yo-quiero-saber/) was a reeimplementation of [VotaInteligente](/votainteligente/).

One of the bigges achievements of Poplus is that it created a network of people and organizations that share similar goals and that share experiences. Thus I visited several Poplus Organizations such as [Sinar Project](http://sinarproject.org/en) in Malaysia and attended twice to the [g0v](http://g0v.tw/en-US/) summit in Taiwan.
